This is the github release of the Kernel Library, for Hydra and DGD.  The
kernellib is and has always been in the public domain (even though it was
distributed with DGD), so this repository includes the full history.  Add
the following empty directories to get started:

    /kernel/data
    /usr
    /usr/System
    /usr/admin

A sample config file is here:

    /doc/kernel/kernel.dgd
