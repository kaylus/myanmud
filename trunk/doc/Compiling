A few useful notes for compiling DGD

DGD's build process is very simple, and doesn't have
a configure script.

DGD can be compiled on Unix alike systems and on Windows,
see doc/Platforms for more information. Also see 
src/host/win32/README for additional information regarding
the Windows build.

There are a few things you can enable/disable by adding the
proper defines to the Makefile on Unix systems, or to your
project on Visual Studio.


NETWORK_EXTENSIONS            Enable extended network functionality
                              (outgoing connections, opening ports
                              from LPC code)

DUMP_FUNCS                    Enable dump_function and dump_object
                              kfuns. Output from those kfuns goes to
                              stderr, they can provide interesting
                              information for those interested in DGD's
                              virtual machine and bytecode interpreter
                              as well as for debugging some problems.

DGD_EXTENSION                 Enable the DGD extension interface, see
                              doc/Extensions for more information about
                              the extension interface.

_FILE_OFFSET_BITS             Linux/Solaris only. Normally this is
                              defined in host.h as _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
                              You can override this from the Makefile
                              if for some reason you need 32 bit file
                              offsets. Note that this limits the size
                              of the swap and dump files to 2GB.

CO_THROTTLE                   Enables callout throttling.  Set it to the
                              maximum number of callouts to run per I/O
                              task.  This can be useful for preventing
                              callout bombs from jamming your mud.
