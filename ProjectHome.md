Mudlib based on the DGD kernel lib and to a lesser extent Melville, which provided me a much important learning experience. Philosophically it's being built toward a specific game, not a general mudlib. As such, the typical things most mudlibs do has lagged behind in favor of fleshing out the actual gamefield. An attempt has been made to bring as many things out in modules as possible for cleaner code and organization. Right now it is a lot of slipping around on the guts of the project and many things going along toward alpha.
