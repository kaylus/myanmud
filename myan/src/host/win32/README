To compile DGD on Win32, you'll need Visual C++ 6.0 or later, with a recent
platform SDK update.

On my NT4 system, DGD has to be explicitly linked with a library called
NAFXCW.LIB.  But using VC++ 6.0 on XP, this library is (apparently) linked
with implicitly; you may have to remove it from the project configuration.
