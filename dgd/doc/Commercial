From January 9, 1996 till March 29, 2001 the commercial rights to DGD were
licensed exclusively to ichat, inc., which was later renamed to Acuity
Corporation.

As of March 29, 2001 DGD can again be licensed directly from BeeHive Internet
Technologies.  Direct enquiries to dgd.licensing@dworkin.nl (changed from
dgd-licensing@dworkin.nl due to spam abuse).

On August 6th, 2005, all rights to DGD were acquired by Dworkin B.V. in the
Netherlands.  BeeHive Internet Technologies, Inc. is still a license holder
and value-added reseller of the software.
