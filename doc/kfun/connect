NAME
	connect - initiate a tcp connection

SYNOPSIS
	void connect(string ipnumber, int port)


DESCRIPTION
	Initiate a telnet or tcp connection to the specified host and port,
	and associate the connection with this object when it is established.

	When the connection succeeds, open() will be called in obj.  If it
	fails or times out, unconnected() will be called in obj.  After the
	connection is established, obj will be a normal user object.

ERRORS
	An error will result if the object was already has a connection,
	port, or editor associated with it.
	If the number of existing port and connection objects is equal
	to the value of status()[ST_UTABSIZE], calling connect() results
	in an error.
